    Hello World

<h1>Today topic is Recommender Systems</h1>

Lets say a company like Netflix, Amazon, Disney Hotstar need to recommend the correct user profile the matching movie, so that there is a high chance that many users
will see the recommended movie thereby increasing profit
for the companies in many ways.
</br>
</br>
</br>
Lets see what are all the data available for the recommender system to learn from. There are user ratings movie, user profile information and movie information.
</br>
User rating movie is taken from the movie reviews given by users.
</br>
User profile information is all the information they ask you and you give them when you create an account and after which anything you do in the website, can also 
be tracked to have more info about the user, like watching a trailer, searching for a genre, even avoiding some content, etc.
</br>
Movie information is like the cast in the movie, genre, director, producing company, animated or not, country of origin, etc.
</br>
</br>
</br>
Lets assume all these information as matrices like user-movie rating as \(M_um)


  
    <p>Here is an inline equation: \(E = mc^2\)</p>
    <p>Here is a display equation:</p>
    <p>
        \[
        \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
        \]
